                 seeking stable income and a balanced portfolio. They come in various types, including government, corporate, and municipal bonds, 
                 offering flexibility to meet different financial goals

                future, allowing you to invest in a range of assets, including stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.

                resources, or agricultural goods, commodities provide an opportunity to invest in the basic materials 
                that drive economic growth
